1. DEPENDENCIES
===============
For running:
- libnetfilter_queue
	* Debian: apt-get install libnetfilter-queue1
- iptables with QUEUE target and STATE module support

For building:
- libnetfilter_queue headers
	* Debian: apt-get install libnetfilter-queue-dev

2. HOW TO BUILD
===============
Just "make" it.

3. HOW TO RUN
=============
Don't. It's not finished or stable or secure and may cause serious injury
or death to you and your computer.

If you are of the Indiana Jones type, you can try the following:

1) add the QUEUE target to the output rules to tell iptables to queue the packets
   for userspace processing:
   
	iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state=NEW -j QUEUE
   
2) run the firewall executable (needs root privileges)

	./firewall

Right now, you can just watch your TCP SYN packets get decoded and translated
to an application name.

4. HOW DOES IT WORK?
====================
The software receives the packets via the netfilter/netlink API and does the
following:

1. get interface name from API
2. takes the payload and decodes IP/IP6/TCP/UDP/ICMP/ICMP6 headers
3. parses /proc/net/{tcp,tcp6,udp,udp6,icmp}, matches the local and remote
   addresses to the one in the packet and retrieves the inode number
4. traverses all /proc/*/fd directories to find the entry that matches
	"socket:[INODE]" where INODE is the number we have found in the /proc/net/*
	table. If a match is found, collect the pid and cmdline.
